# Attention: The bot automatically rewrites its own configuration in human-readable form.
# All channels with a "to:" field will have "r" (read-only) mode activated and will be read.
# Channels without "to:" will still be read and saved in the database.
# Section names must be unique. If duplicate section names are found, the last one will be used.

# Example section configuration:
# -------------------------
<unique_name>:
  mode: r                    # "r" for read-only, "i" for interactive (botcommands), "ir" for interactive + request mode
  channelbotname: <name>      # Overwrites default bot command, e.g., eva, adam, etc. (default: chandlerbot.conf:botcommand)
  autosync: true              # true or false (default is false). WARNING: TARGET CHANNEL MUST BE FULLY READ IN DATABASE.
  disabled: false             # true to disable, "updatedb" to update the database, false by default
  from: <channelid>           # from:type:topicid - forward only files from a specific topic

    - <channelid1>
    - <channelid2>:topic:<topicid>  # Forward messages to a specific topic within the channel
    - <channelid3>
    - <channelid4>
    # Additional channels as needed

  # Redirect search results from another channel to this one
  redirectout: <channelid>:<link|id>:<targetchannelid>  # Searches in <channelid> and forwards to <targetchannelid>
  
  # Search and listing commands
